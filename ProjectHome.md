A fork from google pinyin on android

**This is not a long term project, it only began as some kind of prove concept project.**

**As this project starter (wengxt), I'm not interested in adding any new feature to this library. Since it would be only kind of re-inventing wheel against sunpinyin or libpinyin.**

**This project is only forked from out dated code of Google Pinyin on Android (Not the desktop version), and Google no longer provides up to date code for it since 2009.**

**If you are interested in full featured pinyin input method,  please try libpinyin or sunpinyin, they are both supported by fcitx and ibus. They use more advanced algorithm (2-gram vs this project's unigram) and support more feature, like Shuangpin, Zhuyin, Fuzzy Pinyin and so on. Thank you.**

If you are looking for extra feature with libgooglepinyin, you can try fcitx-googlepinyin, and get support with fcitx's quickphrase, virtual keyboard, cloudpinyin, or customizable punctuation feature for free.
